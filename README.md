# DistHelm-S.C.A.M-Equinox-MLH

## Inspiration
COVID-19 can spread from all directions and we need to be at a safe distance from every side. Now we can be cautious and stop anyone who is coming close to us from front, left or right. But we will have no clue if someone comes from behind.
## What it does
This helmet makes sure that the person behind us is at a safe distance. If he/she comes too close, a buzzer will go off indicating the person to move away. This way we can make sure that social distance is being maintained from all directions. This helmet is especially for construction workers. Our project makes sure that there is a minimum safe distance between workers while they are on their job.
## How we built it
We used an Arduino UNO to program an ultrasonic sensor and connected it to a buzzer, Neo-pixel ring, and an LCD display which is regulated with the help of a potentiometer. We coded the Arduino such that if someone comes closer than the minimum distance then the buzzer will go off, the LCD will display a message ('Alert Unsafe Distance') and the neo pixel ring will light up (green>yellow>red based on the distance). We also used Fusion 360 software to design a 3d model of the helmet.
## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to make the helmet work and look aesthetic at the same time.
The assembly of the circuit was a little bit tricky.
As this was our first hack, we had almost no idea about any of the tracks, software, or program.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We started with very little idea of what we will be doing but as time went by we were able to make everything work and implement new ideas along the way.
## What we learned
We became more familiar with fusion 360, tinkercad and now have a better understanding of how Ardunio UNO works. 
## What's next for Untitled
The circuit design we used can be implemented in various other fields such as:
a) defense - can be used as a high range detector in the military
b) security - can be used to trigger a bank vault alarm system
## Reference
We referred to ELÉTRICA SIMULAÇÕES's project on (create.arduino.cc) and modified it according to our needs. For the Arduino circuit, we reffered to shubham_rattra on Thinkercad.
